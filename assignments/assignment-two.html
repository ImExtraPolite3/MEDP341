            The website that I decided to go with was
            <a href="https://eager-hamilton-724cee.netlify.app/" target="_blank"
              >OpenWeather</a
            >. This website uses alot of flex-box in order format the page. The
            website also uses react in order to create the HTML and also add the
            functionality such the search button and the button used to switch
            from Celsius and Farenheit. The website also uses an API in order to
            acurately display the weather in real time.
