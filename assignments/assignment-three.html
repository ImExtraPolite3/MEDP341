            I mainly focused on using media queries in order to make the site
            responsive and adding animation to my website. Using keyframes I
            added animation to the navigation bar as well as the main content of
            the page.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            When in full screen, the navigation bar starts from 0 opacity and
            slides in from the left and becomes fully visible by the time the
            animation finishes. The main content as start starts from 0 opacity
            but starts from the top and slides down.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            When on mobile, the main content slides from the right until it is
            fully visible. I also have have a hambuger menu in the the top right
            which allow you to traverse my site. I added animation to the
            hambuger menu so that when you click on it the menu transforms into
            an X.
