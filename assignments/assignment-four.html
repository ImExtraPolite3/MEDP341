            The website that I decided to go with was
            <a
              href="https://taper.badquar.to/11/click_to_confirm.html"
              target="_blank"
              >Click To Confirm</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            This website makes great use of the &lt;details&gt; and
            &lt;summary&gt; tags in order to hide and display the text.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            When looking at the page you quickly realize that you are looking at
            an illusion. The lines look curved however they are all straight.
            This illusion was made using css-gradient on the summary tags. With
            the use the css function "calc()" this allows the creator to
            precisly put the squares in areas that would perpetuate the
            illusion.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The JavaScript is what is used to dynamically create the tags as
            well as the hidden text that is also dynamically created using a set
            of words from predefined lists. It also allows the user to click on
            any of the sections in order to see the hidden text. Each time a new
            section is clicked, other sections close automatically.
